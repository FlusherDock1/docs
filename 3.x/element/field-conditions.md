# Field Conditions

Sometimes you may want to manipulate the value or appearance of a form field under certain conditions, for example, you may want to hide an input if a checkbox is ticked or preset the value of another field.

## Trigger Events

Trigger Events are defined with the `trigger` form field property and is a simple browser based solution that uses JavaScript. It allows you to change elements attributes such as visibility or value, based on another elements' state. Here is a sample definition:

```yaml
is_delayed:
    label: Send later
    comment: Place a tick in this box if you want to send this message at a later time.
    type: checkbox

send_at:
    label: Send date
    type: datepicker
    cssClass: field-indent
    trigger:
        action: show
        field: is_delayed
        condition: checked
```

In the above example the `send_at` form field will only be shown if the `is_delayed` field is checked. In other words, the field will show (action) if the other form input (field) is checked (condition). The `trigger` definition specifies these options:

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**action** | defines the action applied to this field when the condition is met. Supported values: show, hide, enable, disable, empty.
**field** | defines the other field name that will trigger the action. Normally the field name refers to a field in the same level form. For example, if this field is in a [repeater widget](#widget-repeater), only fields in that same repeater widget will be checked. However, if the field name is preceded by a caret symbol `^` like: `^parent_field`, it will refer to a repeater widget or form one level higher than the field itself. Additionally, if more than one caret `^` is used, it will refer that many levels higher: `^^grand_parent_field`, `^^^grand_grand_parent_field`, etc.
**condition** | determines the condition the specified field should satisfy for the condition to be considered "true". Supported values: checked, unchecked, value[somevalue].

## Input Preset Converter

The input preset converter is defined with the `preset` form field property and allows you to convert text entered into an element to a URL, slug or file name value in another input element.

In this example we will automatically fill out the `url` field value when a user enters text in the `title` field. If the text **Hello world** is typed in for the Title, the URL will follow suit with the converted value of **/hello-world**. This behavior will only occur when the destination field (`url`) is empty and untouched.

```yaml
title:
    label: Title

url:
    label: URL
    preset:
        field: title
        type: url
```

Alternatively, the `preset` value can also be a string that refers to the **field** only, the `type` option will then default to **slug**.

```yaml
slug:
    label: Slug
    preset: title
```

The following options are available for the `preset` option:

Option | Description
------------- | -------------
**field** | defines the other field name to source the value from.
**type** | specifies the conversion type. See below for supported values.
**prefixInput** | optional, prefixes the converted value with the value found in the supplied input element using a CSS selector.

Following are the supported types:

Type | Description
------------- | -------------
**exact** | copies the exact value
**slug** | formats the copied value as a slug
**url** | same as slug but prefixed with a /
**camel** | formats the copied value with camelCase
**file** | formats the copied value as a file name with whitespace replaced with dashes
