# Balloon Selector

`balloon-selector` - renders a list, where only one item can be selected at a time.

```yaml
gender:
    label: Gender
    type: balloon-selector
    default: female
    options:
        female: Female
        male: Male
```

Balloon selectors support the same methods for defining the options as the [dropdown field type](#field-dropdown).
